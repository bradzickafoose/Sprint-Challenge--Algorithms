#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Runtime: **O(n)**

`a = 0` is a single operation equal to **0(1)**. The `while` loop iterates **n^3** times, but the counter(a) is incremented by **n^2**.

b) Runtime: **O(n log(n))**

`sum = 0` is a single operation equal to **0(1)**. The `for` loop iterates n times, but the `while` loop interates **log n** times.

c) Runtime: **O(n)**

The `if` statement is a single operation equal to **0(1)**. The recursive statement will loop n times.
